I finished building the two rocks, the fish and the tail, and the tail has a wiggling animation. The construction of the seagrass is then completed, and the seagrass moves with the same wiggling animation. Finally, the construction of the villain is completed, and there are related animations on the legs, but the operation of continuous blowing of bubbles cannot be completed, and the bubbles can only be blown once at the beginning of the animation.
